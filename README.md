# Consolidation Unit Project
(for the final unit of ENGCMP 0610 - Composing Digital Media)

**Proposal:** For the final project, I would like to expand on my Photoshop skills working with photos (since I worked with graphic icons for the visual rhetoric unit). I want to make a visual based on "The Spoon Theory" written by Christine Miserandino and the surrounding chronic illness community. At this point, I plan to work solo for the project. With regard to what I already know versus what I need to know, I know basic concepts of PS like layering, selection, opacity, etc. that will definitely be needed for this project. I will also need to expand my skillset to do things like use underlying layers to alter the above layer's color.

*Task List:*
- source assets
- combine spoon and pill capsule images to make the base level photoshop project (a pill filled with spoons, to visually link spoons to the idea of health)
- add the above combined asset to an image of either someone holding a pill in their hand or holding it between their teeth, if time allows
- add text (if I'm short on time, I might just add the word "spoonie" and a link at the bottom to Miserandino's essay, or, if I have more time, I will made the image the centerpiece to a mock magazine cover called "The Spoonie Press" with the "R" in press being the Rx graphic. The latter idea would also include some text boxes with fake article titles/descriptions)

- a backup idea of the spoon-pill combination doesn't work is to photoshop the spoon into someone's hand or teeth as if it were pill-sized

*Assets:*
- image of an empty pill capsule, with one half clear (clear half will be filled with spoons)
- several images of differently-styled spoons
- image of either hand holding something I can easily crop out OR teeth biting down on pill that I can swap for my created pill asset

**-THE CALENDAR (a rough estimate)-**

*by end-of-week 2021-04-17?* Have my assets picked, downloaded, and cited properly. Ideally, by the end of the weekend, I will have the pill-spoon combined image done, or know if I need to resort to my backup idea. 

*by Tuesday, 2021-11-20?* Have whatever base images with the basic text implemented.

*by Thursday, 2021-11-22 (the last day of classes)?* Have my reflection done. If I have extra time, I want to stretch the text component of my project to be a mock-magazine cover.
