# Consolidation Unit Project
(for the final unit of ENGCMP 0610 - Composing Digital Media)

*Introduction:*
These visuals are inspired by "The Spoon Theory" written by Christine Miserandino (source: https://butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/) and the surrounding chronic illness community. The version 1 visual is made as a poster to raise awareness of Miserandino's writing and the concept of invisible illness, making the target audience people outside of the spoonie community. The version 2 visual is a cover for a faux magazine that would have the target audience of the chronic illness community themselves.

*Repository Navigation:*
1. **General** - ASSETS.md and README.md can be found in the main repository. Progress screenshots are in the progress-screenshots folder.
    *(The progress screenshots are tagged with the version they apply to. "v1.5" refers to a direction I experimented with, and learned about new tools during the process, but ultimately decided not to include as a finalized piece.)*
2. **"The Spoonie Pill"** - A .psd and .png file of the pill-and-spoon image combination can be found in the version1 folder.
3. **"The Spoonie PRxESS"** - The version2 folder will hold a .psd and .png file of the stretch-goal project, which is a mock magazine cover
